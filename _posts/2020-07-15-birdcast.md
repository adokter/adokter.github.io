At [BirdCast](https://birdcast.info) we develop and maintains tools that predict and monitor bird migration. These include forecast bird migration maps that predict where and when bird migration will occur, live bird migration maps that show where migration is occurring in real-time, and migration alerts to which one can subscribe to learn when bird migration will occur. Data from weather surveillance radar are essential for developing and maintaining these tools.

The BirdCast site recently got a beautiful redesign on Sept. 1 2020. Check it out at [https://birdcast.info](https://birdcast.info)! 

For the project I develop and maintain the [live migration maps](https://birdcast.info/migration-tools/live-migration-maps/). The maps show you every night the numbers and flight directions of birds in the air.
