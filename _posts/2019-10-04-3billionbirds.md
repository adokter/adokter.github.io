For a large collaborative study into ongoing population changes in North America, I tracked bird biomass flows through the US since 2007 with the NEXRAD weather radar network

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/3billionbirds/mean_traffic.gif" caption="Mean seasonal passage of migration since 2007" %}

From the annual biomass passages, long-term trends were estimated, which indicate a large decrease in the number of birds migrating at night over the US.

The total loss in spring passage since 2007 was estimated at 14 +/- 9%. Similar steep declines were found from a comprehensive compilation of ground surveys, including the North-American Breeding Bird Survey, which indicate a loss of 3 billion birds in North America since 1970, or 1 in 4 birds.

The study was published in Science on 4 Oct 2019. Visit [https://www.3billionbirds.org/](https://www.3billionbirds.org/) to download the paper and for more information on the study.
