Sept. 1, 2020, Cornell Lab of Ornithology

We are looking for a quantitative ecologist to join our team to work on the NSF Macrosystems project "MSA: Macro-demography of North America’s migratory birds". During this two-year postdoc position you will work in a dynamic interdisciplinary group of ecologists and data analysts within the Center for Avian Population Studies at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. The project is led by Adriaan Dokter (project PI), in collaboration with [Alison Johnston](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/staff/alison-johnston/) and [Frank La Sorte](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home/staff/frank-la-sorte/) (co-PIs) and others. 

**Job posting** available at [AcademicJobsOnline.org](https://academicjobsonline.org/ajo/jobs/16732). Also submit your application here.

In this 2-year postdoctoral position you will examine population change from a large-scale demographic perspective, relying on ‘big data’ resources that can be readily generalized across many species. You will collaborate with Cornell Lab’s quantitative team to develop macro-demographic indices of avian recruitment and mortality. This is based on continent-wide radar data (NEXRAD), broad-scale citizen-science data (eBird), and fine-scale data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and Phenocam.

Specific duties include:

* Developing and validating novel tools and approaches for estimating macro-demographic indices of abundance, recruitment, and mortality in a large-scale avian migration system, based on radar and eBird data.
* Describing the primary macro-scale demographic patterns and characteristics of the North-American migration system, and testing hypothesized mechanisms for these patterns by quantifying the associations between the macro-demographic indices and extreme climatic events.
* Presenting results at professional meetings, conferences, and popular seminars.
* Preparing peer-reviewed papers and other research products. 

We are looking for an individual that enjoys participating in general project management and working directly with internal and external project collaborators. We need someone who enjoys engaging in ongoing academic and intellectual life. Additionally, we need someone who has:

* Ph.D. in (quantitative) ecology, applied statistics, or a related field with a strong background in data science, statistics, and model development.
* Ability to apply quantitative methods to ecological hypotheses and questions.
* Multi-disciplinary skills to effectively bridge fields, including population ecology, movement ecology, and geospatial statistics.
* Strong record of success conducting research and scholarly activities, including publication in peer-reviewed journals.
* Experience with R and/or other programming languages.
* Experience working with large datasets and cloud computing. 

If you possess these experiences and skills, this may be the role for you!  There are a few other qualifications that we would view as incredibly helpful in this role, to include:

Experience in ornithology and affinity with birds are a bonus, but not required. 

This is a full-time (40 hours/week) position and will be located in Ithaca, New York. This is a one-year appointment with possible extension for a second year, depending on funding and performance.

**Application deadline:** 2020/09/27 11:59PM EST.
